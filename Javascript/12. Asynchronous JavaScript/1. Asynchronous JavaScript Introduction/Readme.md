# Asynchronous JavaScript Introduction

**In this lesson, you'll learn about** the differences between **synchronous**
and **asynchronous** JavaScript. Understanding these concepts is crucial for
writing **efficient** and **responsive** code, especially when dealing with
tasks like **data fetching** and user **interactions**.

## Synchronous JavaScript

Synchronous JavaScript is code that is executed **line by line**, with each task
completing instantly. There is **no delay** in the execution of tasks for these
lines of code.

Here's an example of synchronous JavaScript:

```javascript
const functionOne = () => {
  console.log("Function One");

  functionTwo();

  console.log("Function One, Part 2");
};

const functionTwo = () => {
  console.log("Function Two");
};

functionOne();

// Output:
// Function One
// Function Two
// Function One, Part 2
```

- The code executes in a **straightforward** manner.
- First, `'Function One'` is logged.
- Then, `functionTwo` is invoked, logging `'Function Two'`.
- Finally, back in `functionOne`, `'Function One,Part 2'` is logged.
- The execution is **linear** and **predictable**.

## Asynchronous JavaScript

Now, let's explore **asynchronous** JavaScript by modifying the functions:

```javascript
const functionOne = () => {
  console.log("Function One"); // 1

  functionTwo();

  console.log("Function One, Part 2"); // 2
};

const functionTwo = () => {
  setTimeout(() => console.log("Function Two"), 2000); // 3
};

functionOne();

// Output:
// Function One
// Function One, Part 2
// (after a two-second delay)
// Function Two
```

- In `functionTwo`, instead of a normal `console.log`, we use setTimeout to
  simulate a **delay**, similar to fetching data from a server.
- The `setTimeout` function schedules `'Function Two'` to be logged after a
  **2000-millisecond delay**.
- When you run the script, `'Function One'` and `'Function One,Part 2'` are
  logged **immediately**.
- After a **two-second delay**, `'Function Two'` is logged.

## Why doesn't JavaScript wait?

- JavaScript is designed to be **non-blocking**. If the engine waited for every
  time-consuming task, it could lead to **unresponsive applications**,
  especially if users interact with the webpage during these delays.
- This **non-blocking behavior** allows the JavaScript engine to continue
  executing other code while waiting for **asynchronous tasks** to complete.

## What is asynchronous JavaScript?

Asynchronous JavaScript involves code where some tasks take **time** to
complete. These tasks run in the **background** while the JavaScript engine
continues executing other lines of code. When the result of the asynchronous
task is **available**, it is then used in the program.

## Key Takeaways

- **Synchronous JavaScript**: Executes code line by line, waiting for each task
  to complete before moving on.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Allows tasks to run in the background, enabling
  the engine to continue executing other code. This is essential for handling
  tasks like network requests without freezing the application.

Understanding the difference between **synchronous** and **asynchronous**
JavaScript is vital for building applications that are both **efficient** and
**responsive**. As we progress, you'll learn more about handling asynchronous
operations using **promises**, **async/await**, and other techniques.
