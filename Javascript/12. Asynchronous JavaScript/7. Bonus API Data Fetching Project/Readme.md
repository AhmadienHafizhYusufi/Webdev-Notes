# Bonus: API Data Fetching Project

**In this lesson, you'll gain deeper insights into asynchronous JavaScript**,
including **Promises**, **async/await**, and **API data fetching**.
Additionally, you'll revisit the concept of **object destructuring**, which is a
powerful feature in JavaScript for extracting values from objects and arrays.

## Further Exploration of Asynchronous JavaScript

To truly master these concepts, I recommend watching this comprehensive video
that covers:

- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Understanding how JavaScript handles tasks that
  don't complete immediately.
- **Promises**: Learning how to manage asynchronous operations more effectively.
- **Async/Await**: Simplifying the syntax for working with promises, making your
  code cleaner and more readable.
- **API Data Fetching**: Exploring how to retrieve data from external sources
  using JavaScript.
- **Object Destructuring**: Revisiting this feature to efficiently extract
  values from objects and arrays.

## Getting Started with Node.js

To follow along with the video and practice these concepts, you'll need to have
Node.js installed on your system. Node.js provides a **runtime environment** for
executing JavaScript code outside of a browser, which is essential for
**server-side** development and running JavaScript applications locally.

### Installation Steps:

1. Visit the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Download the installer for your operating system.
3. Follow the installation instructions to set up Node.js on your machine.

Once Node.js is installed, you'll be ready to dive deeper into these advanced
JavaScript topics.
