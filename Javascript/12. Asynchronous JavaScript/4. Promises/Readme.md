# Promises

**In this lesson, you'll learn about promises** in JavaScript, which provide a
more readable and manageable way to handle **asynchronous operations** compared
to **callback functions**. Promises help you avoid "**callback hell**" and make
it easier to handle both successful and failed asynchronous operations.

## Promises

In the last lecture, we witnessed the challenges of callback hell. Promises come
to the rescue by offering a **cleaner** and more **structured** way to handle
asynchronous tasks.

## What are promises?

They are **objects** that represent the eventual **completion** (or **failure**)
of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises can either return
the successfully fetched data or an **error**.

## Creating a Promise

Let's create a simple promise:

```javascript
// Creating the promise
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Got the user");
    resolve({ user: "Adrian" });
  }, 2000);
});

// Getting the data from the promise
promise.then((user) => {
  console.log(user);
});
```

- A promise is created using the `Promise` constructor, which takes a function
  with `resolve` and `reject` parameters.
- Inside the promise, you perform your **asynchronous operation**. If
  successful, call `resolve` with the result.
- Use `.then()` to handle the resolved value of the promise.

## Handling Errors with Promises

Promises also make it easy to handle errors. You can replace `resolve` with
`reject` to simulate an error:

```javascript
// Creating the promise
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Got the user");
    // resolve({ user: 'Adrian' });
    reject("Error");
  }, 2000);
});

// Getting the data from the promise
// .then gives us the result of the resolve and .catch gives us the result of the reject
promise
  .then((user) => {
    console.log(user);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

- Use `.catch()` to handle errors when the promise is rejected.

## Refactoring Callback Hell with Promises

Let's refactor the previous callback example using **promises**:

```javascript
console.log(1);

const fetchUser = (username) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Now we have the user");
      resolve(username);
    }, 2000);
  });
};

const fetchUserPhotos = (username) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Now we have the photos");
      resolve(["photo1", "photo2"]);
    }, 2000);
  });
};

const fetchPhotoDetails = (photo) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Now we have the photo details");
      resolve("details...");
    }, 2000);
  });
};

// Calling the functions with promises
fetchUser("Adrian")
  .then((user) => fetchUserPhotos(user))
  .then((photos) => fetchPhotoDetails(photos[0]))
  .then((detail) => console.log(detail))
  .catch((error) => console.log(error));

console.log(2);
```

- Each function returns a promise, allowing you to chain them using `.then()`.
- This approach is much **cleaner** and **easier to read** compared to nested
  callbacks.
- The `.catch()` method at the end handles any **errors** that occur in the
  promise chain.

## Key Takeaways

- **Promises** provide a more **readable** and **manageable** way to handle
  asynchronous operations.
- They allow you to **chain operations** and **handle errors** gracefully.
- Promises help avoid **callback hell**, making your code easier to
  **maintain**.

In the next lesson, you'll learn about `async/await`, a recent addition to
JavaScript that builds on promises to make asynchronous code even more
**intuitive**.
