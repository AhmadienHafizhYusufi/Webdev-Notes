# Tricky Concepts

In this lesson, you'll learn about some of the more advanced and tricky concepts
in JavaScript: `Scope`, `Hoisting`, and `Closures`. These are important topics,
especially for understanding how JavaScript works under the hood and for
technical interviews.

## Overview of Upcoming Lessons

In the upcoming three lessons, we're going to cover some tricky concepts in
JavaScript: `Scope`, `Hoisting`, and `Closures`.

1. `Scope` : We'll start with the concept of **scope**, which is fundamental to
   any programming language. Scope determines the **accessibility** of variables
   and functions in different parts of your code.
2. `Hoisting` : Next, we'll discuss **hoisting**, a JavaScript-specific behavior
   that affects variable and function declarations. While hoisting might not be
   something you use consciously in everyday coding, understanding it can help
   you avoid potential pitfalls.
3. `Closures` : Finally, we'll explore **closures**, a powerful feature in
   JavaScript that allows functions to retain access to their **lexical scope**
   even when executed outside of it. Closures are often considered tricky but
   are incredibly useful once you understand them.

While these concepts might not be part of your daily coding routine, they are
important to know, especially since questions about closures and hoisting often
come up in technical interviews. I've got you covered! 😉

As we dive into each topic, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how JavaScript
works and be better prepared for any questions that come your way. Let's get
started!
