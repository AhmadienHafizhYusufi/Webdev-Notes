## Document Object Model (DOM)

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a standard for **accessing** and
**interacting** with documents over the internet. It represents the
**structure** of a **document** and provides a way for programming languages
like JavaScript to **understand** and **modify** it.

### What is the DOM?

- **Structure Representation**: The DOM represents how a document is structured,
  allowing for easy access and modification.
- **Language Agnostic**: While the DOM is not a programming language itself, it
  provides a standard interface for languages like JavaScript to interact with
  documents.
- **HTML Focus**: In this lesson, we'll focus on the HTML DOM, which defines how
  an HTML page is structured and can be modified.

### HTML DOM

The HTML DOM is a tree of nested HTML elements that **define the structure** of
a web page. It specifies:

- **Structure**: How an HTML page is organized.
- **Modification**: How elements can be added, removed, or changed.
- **Properties and Styles**: Attributes and styles that can be applied to
  elements.
- **Standards**: The version of the standard to be followed and valid elements
  for structuring a page.

### Core and Specific DOMs

- **Core DOM**: Defines the basic structure for all documents.
- **Specific DOMs**: Extend the core DOM to support specific document types,
  such as HTML and XML.
