# Assignment Operators

**In this lesson, you'll learn** about assignment operators in JavaScript and
how they are used to **assign and manipulate values** in variables.

## Assignment Operators

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of
its right operand.

## Basic Assignment Operator `=`

Would you believe me if I told you that you not only know what an **assignment
operator** is, but that you've been using it this whole time? The simplest form
of an assignment operator is the `=` equal sign used for assigning values to
variables:

`const number = 5;`

## Compound Assignment Operators

We can also combine the assignment operator with one of the **arithmetic
operators** to perform an operation and assignment in one step:

```javascript
let number = 5;

number += 5; // the same as number = number + 5;
number -= 5; // the same as number = number - 5;
number *= 5; // the same as number = number * 5;
number /= 5; // the same as number = number / 5;
console.log(number);
```

## String Concatenation with Assignment

The addition assignment can also be used with strings! Let me show you:

```javascript
let string = "Hello";
string += ", I am John.";
console.log(string);
```

That's it when it comes to assignment operators—you're basically a pro at them!
