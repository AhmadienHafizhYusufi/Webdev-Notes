# Operators Intro

We know many operators from school, like: addition `+`, multiplication `*`, and
subtraction `-`.

In programming, operators perform operations on data values (operands) and
produce results.

For example, in `1 + 2`:

- `+` is the operator
- `1` is the left operand
- `2` is the right operand
- Resulting in `3`

## JavaScript includes the following categories of `operators`:

- Arithmetic Operators: **5 + 3** results in **8**.
- Comparison Operators: **5 > 3** results in **true**.
- Logical Operators: **true && false** results in **false**.
- Assignment Operators: **let x = 5; x += 3;** results in **x** being **8**.
- Conditional (Ternary) Operator: let result = **(5 > 3) ? 'Yes' : 'No';**
  results in result being **'Yes'**.

In the next few lessons, we'll explore these operators in detail.
