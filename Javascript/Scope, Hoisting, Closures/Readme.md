## Overview

1. `Scope` : Scope determines the accessibility of variables and functions in
   different parts of your code.
2. `Hoisting` : a JavaScript-specific behavior that affects variable and
   function declarations.
3. `Closures` : a powerful feature in JavaScript that allows functions to retain
   access to their **lexical scope** even when executed outside of it.
